resources are a little bit messy.
Resources are stored in rc.py
this file must be generated EVERYTIME a resource changes.
That is done running the script resources.bat

rc.qrc is says what's inside the resources. Please edit it with QtDesigner.
main.ui loads rc.qrc so edit it from there.

trans/gf.pro has the definition of some stuff, like, which forms are going to be used. so if you create a .ui, add it there, so it can be translated.

if a resource change fails, try to delete rc.pyC first. that's a cache file.
